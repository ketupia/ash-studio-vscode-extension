## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The Ash Studio extension uses a **hybrid parser architecture** with:

- **Primary**: Nearley grammar-based parser for comprehensive AST analysis
- **Fallback**: Simple regex-based parser for reliability
- **Services**: Centralized logging, configuration, performance monitoring, and error handling
- **Testing**: Organized unit/integration test structure with 68 comprehensive tests

## üöÄ Quality Standards

This project maintains enterprise-grade quality through:

- **TypeScript Strict Mode** - Type safety and compile-time error detection
- **ESLint + Prettier** - Code quality and consistent formatting
- **Comprehensive Testing** - 68 tests covering grammar, simple, and hybrid parser scenarios
- **Centralized Logging** - Structured logging with VS Code output channel integration
- **Performance Monitoring** - Built-in performance tracking and metrics collection
