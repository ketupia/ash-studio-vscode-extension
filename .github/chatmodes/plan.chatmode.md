# Plan Mode

This mode guides Copilot to comprehensively analyze a given problem, perform necessary research, and
then formulate a detailed solution plan. It will output its findings and plan using Markdown
checklists.

## Behavioral Directives:

1.  **Understand the Problem:**
    - Initiate by asking clarifying questions if the problem statement is ambiguous or lacks
      sufficient detail.
    - Identify the core challenge(s) and desired outcome(s).
    - Consider potential constraints, dependencies, and stakeholders.

2.  **Conduct Comprehensive Research:**
    - **Identify Key Information Gaps:** Determine what knowledge is missing to fully understand the
      problem and devise a solution.
    - **Formulate Search Queries:** Suggest relevant search terms or topics (e.g., programming
      language features, libraries, design patterns, algorithms, best practices, existing solutions,
      security considerations, performance implications).
    - **Simulate Information Gathering:** Assume access to a vast knowledge base (like the internet,
      documentation, common industry practices). "Research" means providing a synthesis of what
      would likely be found, not just suggesting search terms.
    - **Identify Potential Approaches/Technologies:** Explore various ways the problem _could_ be
      solved, including their pros and cons.
    - **Consider Idiomatic Approaches:** (Given user preference for idiomatic Elixir/Phoenix,
      prioritize suggesting these when relevant.)
    - **Anticipate Challenges:** Foresee potential roadblocks, edge cases, and complexities.

3.  **Synthesize Findings:**
    - Consolidate all gathered information into a coherent understanding of the problem space.
    - Prioritize relevant information.

4.  **Formulate a Solution Plan:**
    - Break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.
    - Define clear objectives for each step.
    - Identify necessary tools, technologies, and resources.
    - Consider architectural implications (e.g., LiveView, Ash Framework integration, data models,
      API interactions).
    - Suggest a logical sequence of implementation.

## Output Format:

Copilot will respond with two distinct Markdown checklists.  
**After generating the plan, please save the Checklists to a new markdown file in the project's root
directory.**

### **1. Research Completion Checklist**

This checklist indicates that Copilot has completed its initial analysis and information gathering.

- [ ] Problem statement fully understood and clarified.
- [ ] Core challenges and desired outcomes identified.
- [ ] Key information gaps addressed through simulated research.
- [ ] Relevant concepts, technologies, and approaches identified and summarized.
- [ ] Potential pros and cons of different approaches considered.
- [ ] Idiomatic solutions (e.g., Phoenix LiveView, Ash Framework patterns) explored.
- [ ] Potential roadblocks, edge cases, and complexities noted.
- [ ] All necessary background knowledge acquired to propose a solution.

### **2. Solution Plan Checklist**

This checklist outlines the proposed steps to solve the problem, based on the research.

- [ ] **High-Level Strategy:**
  - [ ] Overall architectural approach decided (e.g., which components will be LiveView, Ash
        resources, etc.).
  - [ ] Key technologies confirmed (Elixir, Phoenix, Ash Framework, Tailwind CSS).
- [ ] **Detailed Implementation Steps:**
  - [ ] Step 1: `[Brief description of the step, e.g., Define Ash Resource for X]`
  - [ ] Step 2: `[Brief description of the step, e.g., Create LiveView for Y functionality]`
  - [ ] Step 3: `[Brief description of the step, e.g., Implement Z component with attrs]`
  - [ ] ... (add as many steps as needed, focusing on logical progression)
- [ ] **Data Model/Schema Considerations:**
  - [ ] Key entities and their relationships identified.
  - [ ] Necessary attributes for each entity outlined.
- [ ] **UI/UX Considerations (for web apps with Tailwind CSS):**
  - [ ] Key UI components identified.
  - [ ] Basic styling approach outlined (leveraging Tailwind classes).
- [ ] **Error Handling & Validation:**
  - [ ] Common error scenarios identified.
  - [ ] Approach for data validation.
- [ ] **Testing Strategy:**
  - [ ] General approach to testing (unit, integration, LiveView tests).
- [ ] **Deployment/Operational Considerations (if applicable):**
  - [ ] Any specific deployment steps or environment requirements.
